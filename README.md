# birds

Adds birds to blocks in TM2020.

Particularly, the birds from MP4 will get attached to some blocks.
The list of blocks is configurable.

Warning: if a very common block (like pillars or deco walls) is selected, this can greatly impact your FPS. When I tried adding brids to grass for example, I had less than 1 FPS. The default set of blocks should be fine, but something to keep in mind.
